A rhyme stem is the portion of the word or phrase that is relevant for rhyme evaluation/judgement.

The **short rhyme stem** of a word is the final vowel of the word plus any and all consonants afterwards.

The **long rhyme stem** of a word is the sequence starting at the main stress of the word and continuing until the end.

To date, all rhymes are judged based off the short rhyme stem.
